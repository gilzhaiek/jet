The terms also apply to any related Rx Networks products or services such as:

By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.

These rights survive this agreement.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws that may apply to the location of your evaluation of the GPStream Software.

This License Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the Province of British Columbia, Canada, excluding rules of private international law that lead to the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties expressly disclaim the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods to the Agreement.
