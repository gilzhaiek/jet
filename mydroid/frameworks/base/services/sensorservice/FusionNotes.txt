To implement Recon Fusion, these changes were made:

1. Added Eigen library files
2. Added stlport and c++ includes to Android.mk
3. Replaced Fusion.cpp and Fusion.h with Recon's

Todo:

1. Substitute Eigen's Vectors and Matrix structures with google's vec.h, mat.h
2. Handle mag, acc and gyro data separately. Right now it's hacked for the three to accumulate before calling one long function
3. Properly correct sensor coordinates to X = East, Y =  North, Z =  Up in the driver. Right now the axis are wrong, and the Z axis of the Magnetometer is flipped
4. getBias() needs to be implemented instead of returning a dummy

To build, install, and reboot:

1. Run buildinstallreboot.sh

Note: Reboot is required to see effect.
