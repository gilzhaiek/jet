Introduction
Recon Instruments Inc. (“Recon”) manufactures and distributes various Heads-Up Display technology products (each a “Recon Device”) that can be used with compatible software applications developed or distributed by Recon or authorized third party developers.
Recon has created the Recon Software Development Kit, comprised of software, sample code and documentation (collectively the “Recon SDK”), that can be used together with a compatible version of the Android™ Software Development Kit licensed by Google Inc. to develop applications to run on compatible Recon Devices. Recon may also provide technical support or other services regarding the Recon SDK (collectively the “Support Services”). This Agreement governs use of the Recon SDK and Support Services.
1.	This Agreement
1.1	Purpose of Agreement:  This Agreement is a binding contract between you and any person (including any legal entity) that you represent (individually and collectively “You” and “Your”) and Recon, and governs Your use of the Recon SDK and Support Services to develop applications for use on compatible Recon Devices (each an “Application”).
1.2	Accepting This Agreement:  In order to use the Recon SDK, You must first agree to this Agreement. By checking a box or clicking to accept or agree to this Agreement (if those options are made available before or during downloading or installation of the Recon SDK), or by downloading, installing or using the Recon SDK, You acknowledge and signify that You unconditionally accept and agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Agreement, and if You are an individual that represents another person then You represent and warrant that You have full legal authority to accept and agree to this Agreement on behalf of that person. If You do not unconditionally accept and agree to this Agreement, or You do not have the requisite legal authority to unconditionally accept and agree to this Agreement on behalf of the person that You represent, then You may not download, install or use the Recon SDK, and You must cancel the installation of the Recon SDK and permanently delete and destroy all copies of the Recon SDK in Your possession or control.
1.3	Prohibited Users:  You may not accept this Agreement or download, install or use the Recon SDK if You are prohibited by applicable law from using the Recon SDK, if Recon has expressly prohibited You from using the Recon SDK or creating an Application, or if Recon has previously terminated or revoked Your license to use the Recon SDK or any other Recon software or any other agreement You previously entered into with Recon.
1.4	Changes to Recon SDK:  Recon in its discretion may issue updates or new versions or releases to or of the Recon SDK without prior notice to You, and those updates, versions or releases may have different features and functionalities than previous versions of the Recon SDK and may be incompatible with an Application developed using previous versions of the Recon SDK. Recon in its discretion may stop (temporarily or permanently) providing the Recon SDK or any feature of the Recon SDK at any time and from time to time without prior notice to You. This Agreement applies to all updates or new versions or releases to or of the Recon SDK unless Recon indicates that the update or new version or release is subject to a separate agreement, in which case the separate agreement will govern.
2.	License to Use Recon SDK
2.1	License Grant:  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Recon grants to You a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, royalty-free, revocable, limited and restricted license during the term of this Agreement to use the Recon SDK (in object code format only) for the sole purpose of developing one or more Applications.
2.2	General Restrictions/Requirements:  You will not: (a) use, disclose or provide or permit access to or use of the Recon SDK except as expressly set forth in this Agreement; (b) except for the development of Applications in accordance with this Agreement, copy or reproduce (except to install a reasonable number of copies of the Recon SDK on computers and back-up devices owned or used exclusively by You), translate, modify, adapt or enhance the Recon SDK, create derivative works (including any other software) from the Recon SDK, or merge, embed or combine the Recon SDK with any other software or materials; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, convert into human-readable form, or otherwise attempt to access or derive the source code of the Recon SDK, except to the extent required for a limited lawful purpose authorized by applicable law; (d) make any changes, modifications, additions or improvements to the Recon SDK; (e) license, sublicense, sell, resell, lend, lease, loan, share, transfer, assign, pledge, publish, transmit, publicly display or perform, distribute, rent, create any interest in, or otherwise give or make available or permit the use of the Recon SDK to or for the benefit of any other person, whether as a service bureau or otherwise, and with or without charge; (f) alter, attempt to circumvent, destroy, obscure or remove any notices (including trademark and copyright notices), proprietary codes or locks, means of identification, digital rights tools or management information or agreements on, in or in relation to the Recon SDK or any technical restrictions or limitations in the Recon SDK that are designed to limit or restrict the use of the Recon SDK; or (g) permit or assist any other person to use the Recon SDK in a way that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if done by You. You will protect the Recon SDK against unauthorized access, distribution or use. Regardless of the number of copies of the Recon SDK received by You or the means or media by which You receive them, each copy of the Recon SDK is subject to this Agreement. You will ensure that each copy of the Recon SDK that You make, install or use pursuant to this Agreement is a complete copy, including all proprietary rights notices and legal notices included by Recon in the Recon SDK.
