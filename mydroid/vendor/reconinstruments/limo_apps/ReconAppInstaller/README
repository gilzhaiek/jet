This package contains code for updating device firmware, and
installing rif files, by observing specific file paths for changes.

RIF Installer:
checks files placed in /ReconApps/Installer and decodes
them into apk files inside the applications cache directory, then
installs the apk automatically without user intervention, whether the
app is already installed or not. It will delete the rif files or apk
files either on successful installation or on any error.

To install the apk, it uses reflection to call private methods inside
the PackageManager, it calls the same methods that would be called
internally by com.android.packageinstaller


See system/README for old code for installing system apps

Detailed procedure:
1. Observe /sdcard/ReconApps/Installer/
2. Change causes RifEventFolder
3. Pop the top file. 
4. Decode to APK folder /cached/
5. call the installer function
6. Call back causes poping the next item.


Note: the method used here of using rif files to secure apks is not 
completely secure because the apk needs to be publically readable at some
point in order for android to read it, and android will log the apk name as it installs
long term it might make more sense to use encrypted apks which android itself 
can decode (available jelly bean onwards)
see http://nelenkov.blogspot.ca/2012/07/using-app-encryption-in-jelly-bean.html
ie. apk install --algo .. --key .., should also be possible via reflection
