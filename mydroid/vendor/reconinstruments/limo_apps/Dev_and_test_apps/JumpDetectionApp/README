This app contains a stand-alone activity that detects jumps based on
recon sensor framework. It uses free fall interrupt listener in the
context of android framework (with free fall event added by
recon). Following receiving of this free fall interrupt it will put
another instance of sensor listener into high freq read. and calculate
jump height and distance.

To have a fully working solution, the algorithms implemented in the
activity should be put in a service and then interfaced with MOD Service.
