This is an example Android Studio and Gradle project that contains three subprojects (aka Android Studio modules): MySDK, MySDK2, and Lib.
 The root build.gradle file adds Gradle tasks for creating a seperate Jar file for the Javadoc and compiled classes. Each of these Jars contain all the Classes from all the subprojects automatically.
