Contains set of classes that can be used by external developers in order to integrate features of MOD Live Platform to their applications.
<p>
Platform Data is managed by the system-wide <i>Transcend</i> Service. One of key goals of the Recon SDk is to shield this
concept from the end developer. SDK Clients communicate instead with a <i>"proxy"</> -
<a href="../../../com/reconinstruments/ReconSDK/ReconSDKManager.html">ReconSDKManager</a> class.
<p> 

Communication with Transcend Service is possible in 2 fundamentally different ways:
<p><ul>
   <li> 1. Subscribe and Publish (Event Notifications)
   <li> 2. On-demand Acquisition (Data Retrieval)
</ul>
<p>
You can think of Event Notifications as Asynchronous Data Events, or <i>interrupts</i> that are propagated to the end client once they become 
available. Data Retrieval on the other hand represents on demand or <i>polling</i> approach - explicit <i>Data Fetch</i>, 
regardless if Events have changed since last update. Full Event History can be retrieved this way as well.
<p>
Direct communication with <i>Transcend</i> while possible, is discouraged and can be regarded as undocumented/advanced feature with no benefits to the end developer.
