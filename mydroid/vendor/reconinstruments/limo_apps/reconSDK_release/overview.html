The Recon Instruments SDK is written as an add-on on top of standard Google Android API.<p>

The exposed API is structured in such a fashion that the learning curve for anyone with Android Development experience should be minimal.
This API is generic across Recon Instruments products – from a developer perspective there is no environment / product distinction (i.e. snow / dirt / etc.).
Instead client apps are written in terms of single generic API while the differences (if any) are handled internally.
This simplifies issues like portability and maintenance for the end developer. <p>

This first version of the SDK focuses on <b><i>"Recon Events"</i></b>. 
This data is logically related to the external Hardware Sensor Input. Recon Events fall into the following 2 categories: <p>
    <ul>
       <li> 1. Direct derivative of Sensor Input (cardinality = 1:1). For instance Temperature Data
       <li> 2. Aggregates of multiple Sensor Input Data gathered over period of time (cardinality = 1:m). For instance Run or Jump Events
    </ul>
</p>
SDK Clients have read-only access to Events which are managed on their behalf by the MOD Live Platform. <p>
Further releases of Recon SDK will add different features, such as the Web Connectivity Framework and Bluetooth Low Energy conectivity etc.
