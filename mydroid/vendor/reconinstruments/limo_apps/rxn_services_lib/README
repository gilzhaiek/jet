Library project provided by rx networks.  It has an RXNetworksService
which we override to have file watcher capabilities. The original
service looks for WiFi capabilities before it downloads and injects a
seed file. We have modified this so that it injects any file that is
created or modified in /data/RXN/seed/. The orginal download
capabilities are intact though. The RXNetworksService that is defined
in this library is used by rxn_services_xybrid.
