####Generic porting:
In the mydroid/device/ti/jet/device.mk file, check ANT plugin modules section

####Build ANT modules
Check mydroid/device/ti/jet/framework/JET_ANT

###Enable ANT for Snow2 manually:
1) clean build snow image

2)
adb install StonestreetOneAntService.apk. This can be built either by the package name StonestreetOneAntService, or using testing project located at tools/StonestreetOneANTService/
##We recommand to use testing project, Because in the Jet project by far, the system is using BLE by default and need to go to the setting menu->sensor and choose ANT mode.

3)
adb install StonestreetOneANTService/prebuilts/Android_ANTRadioService_4-2-0.apk
adb install StonestreetOneANTService/prebuilts/AntPlusPlugins_2.0.0.apk
#The firmware replacement  below is not necessary now because SS1 can send corrcet patch file to the wilink7
#adb remount
#adb push StonestreetOneANTService/prebuilts/BT2.12_ANT_1.17.bts system/etc/firmware/
#adb shell chmod 644 system/etc/firmware/BT2.12_ANT_1.17.bts

4)
#Note: If we want to just simply test ANT without worrying about ANT/BLE switch and BLE service conflict, we need:
adb remount
adb shell rm /system/app/BLEServiceSS1.apk
adb install Home.apk in tools/TestApps

5)Compile and install dummy java library in Android_antradio-library. This dummy library is just used to be compliant with ANT legacy. It will not effect any ANT performance.
