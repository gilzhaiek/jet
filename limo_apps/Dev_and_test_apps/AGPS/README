This is AGPS code from JACK and I removed the hard coded file paths and names.

You can have a look at GPSAssist.java and change the constant path of the aiding files.


To pull all aiding files from the server unit that is collecting ephemeris files, I created

a script file. in server.conf, first line is serial number of the server unit and you can run

prepare_aidings.bash to pull all the files and rename them. And you can push those alm and raw files

to right path and run the assist application.
