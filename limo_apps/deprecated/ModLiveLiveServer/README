not recommended to use this anymore, the HQ Mobile code has diverged a lot since this worked and it is very slow anyway.
Use vnc instead.

ModLiveLive server
=============================================================================

Upon activation by the user through a simply UI, this program
essentially runs a screen capture service. and periodically updates
"/mnt/storage/ReconApps/ModLiveLive/ss.jpg"


This program works closely with a special version of applauncher that
grabs the above image and sends it to a special version HQ Mobile to
for live view.

Compiling this program is simple and follows the usual build as system
app. Below the steps for preparing other components are explained

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing special version of app launcher
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The special version of app launcher should be build with
"HQMobileClassesCES.jar" as opposed to "HQMobileClasses.jar".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing special version of HQ Mobile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The HQ mobile used for live view should be compile from branch
"fullpathfiletransfer"
