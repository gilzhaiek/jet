This package contains three directories:

 * doc/
 * lib/
 * sample_code/

doc/ contains documentation on the SDK.

lib/ contains the jar file for the SDK to be linked to the project.

sample_code/ contains a sample code that uses the SDK in a minimal
application. It can be built using the standard tools e.g. ant. A bash
file that automates the build process is also provided.
