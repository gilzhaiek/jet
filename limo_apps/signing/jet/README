The content of this folder are used for signing apps as system
apps. The platform keys that we use here are the same as the ones we
use in building limo. This folder should be in the same root as the
root folder of the app that is being signed. Then by invoking
make_app.bash from the root of the app folder, the app gets signed
using the keys here.
