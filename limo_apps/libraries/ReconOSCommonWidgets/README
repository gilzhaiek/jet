A unified set of themes and widgets that should replace all UI code and assets that is not unique to any specific project.
In the manifest set application/activities themes like this:
	android:theme="@style/ReconTheme.NoTitleBar"

Currently themes are a simple base on the default themes with only the background set mostly as a place holder, but they should specify things like font colors, selectors etc. And remove those things from layouts.
