This is a simple app to decode and display incoming messages from a wahoo heart rate sensor, cadence/speed sensor, or power sensor.
It is required to pair with the sensors from a different app, currently the BLE Utility app in BLEServiceSS1.

The iOS code from Wahoo that was used to write the decoders is in iOSreference, it can be used to potentially decode more data fields than is currently used in this app.
