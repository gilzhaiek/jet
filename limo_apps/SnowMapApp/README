To build and run this app:

1) choose version of MapSDK rendering: Canvas or OpenGL (noting OpenGL is not fully functional yet)
  - cd limo_apps/MapSDK
  - bash switchRenderingMode.bash [opengl | canvas]
  - ant clean
  - bash make_app.bash (confirms no errors in MapSDK. Optional as it will be done during other builds)
  
2) load SNOW configuration data onto the HUD
  - cd limo_apps/StorageDependencies
  - bash installDependencies snow

  - rebuild/restart GeodataService service (to load SNOW data)
    - cd limo_apps/GeodataService/GeodataService
    - bash clean_build_install_and_run.bash

3) build & install this app
  - cd limo_apps/MapApps/SnowMapApp
  - bash clean_build_install_and_run.bash
  
  
  
Notes:
- step 1 is only required if the MapSDK code has changed or you have switched rendering modes
- step 2 is required at least once to start up the GeodataService.  If only the app is changed, step 2 can be skipped after initial run
